# spa√ü

A [`pass`](https://www.passwordstore.org/)-compatible password manager for the cli.

`spass` is fully backwards compatible with [GNU `pass`](https://www.passwordstore.org/),
but adds a couple of extra features which are nice.

Where `pass`' secret format is almost completely free-form ,
`spass` adds the concept of "named fields" which are a bit like HTTP-headers
and can help you organise the data in your secrets.

A secret has the following structure:
```
<password>
<field name>: <field value>
<unstructured data>
```
For example:
```
pa$$w0rd
domain: example.com
This is some unstructured data that does not have a field name.
issuer: google.com
username: john-doe
```

`spass` also adds support for generating One-Time Passwords (OTPs).
When one of the fields in the secret is a valid
[`otpauth://` uri](https://github.com/google/google-authenticator/wiki/Key-Uri-Format)
`spass` will be able to generate an OTP for it.
